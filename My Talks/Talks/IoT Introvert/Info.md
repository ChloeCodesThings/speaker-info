### Description

You can’t spell “introvert” without “IoT”, which is why Chloe is here to show us how she used Azure IoT services to help her get out of not-so-fun social situations. In this talk, she’ll walk through how you can use a simple Flic button and Azure to save yourself from your next awkward convo.
