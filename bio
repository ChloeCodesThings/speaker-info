Chloe is an SF based Cloud Advocate for Microsoft & the content director for the SF Microsoft Reactor. Pre-Engineering, she spent her nights and weekends performing in the Bay Area as a singer/actress, before attending Hackbright in 2016. Perhaps the only engineer you'll meet who has been in "Hairspray", "Xanadu", "Carrie the Musical", and "Jerry Springer: the Opera"- she is passionate about bringing people with non-traditional backgrounds into the world of tech. If you're trying to place her face, yes- she's the young woman giving the awkward thumbs up in the "What It's Like to be a Woman at a Tech Conference" article (which she also wrote). Previously, she worked at Sentry.io where she created the (DevRel Award Winning) Sentry Scouts program (a camp themed meet-up ft. patches, s’mores, giant squirrel costumes, and hot chocolate). And was recently featured in the Grace Hopper Conference 2018 gallery featuring 15 influential women in STEM by AnitaB.org. Her fake boyfriend app using Azure Functions and the Twilio API was recently featured in Vice’s Motherboard, as well as several other news publications. Chloe prides herself on being one of the only engineers who has played an ogre, crayon, and the back-end of a cow on a professional stage, and hopes to bring more artists into tech, and more engineers into the arts.
